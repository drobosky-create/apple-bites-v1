## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language. Focus on actions and progress rather than repetitive phrases. Perform periodic audits for project cleanup rather than extensive organizational work.

**Development Priority**: Always check Argon Dashboard folder first for any files, templates, or assets. Use Argon components, styles, and logic as the primary source. Only look elsewhere if Argon folder doesn't contain a relevant match.

I'd like to overhaul the Value Improvement Calculator page to align with the grading system used in the Apple Bites Valuation Report. Currently, the slider uses a 30–90 “Value Builder Score” model, which doesn't match the output presented in the executive summary or financial breakdown. Please replace this system with a structure based on A–F grades to create internal consistency, improve clarity, and reflect our actual valuation methodology.

📐 Requirements
1. Replace Score-Based Slider with Grade-Based Slider
Slider should now use discrete grade stops: A, B, C, D, and optionally F.

Slider title: "Adjust Your Operational Grade"

Subtext: Move the slider to see how improving your business operations impacts your valuation.

2. Map Valuation Multiples to Grades
Use the following logic to dynamically update valuation outputs when the grade slider changes. Each grade corresponds to a specific EBITDA multiple:

Grade	EBITDA Multiple Range	Suggested Display
A	6.5x to 9.0x	7.5x default
B	5.0x to 6.4x	5.7x default
C	3.5x to 4.9x	4.2x default
D	2.5x to 3.4x	3.0x default
F	< 2.5x	2.0x default

Use adjusted EBITDA input (e.g., $1,379,841) to compute and display the valuation.

🖥️ Display Logic
Left card (Current Value):

Title: Current Value

Subtitle: Based on your Operational Grade of X

Show EBITDA multiple and valuation

Right card (Potential Value):

Title: Potential Value

Subtitle: With an Operational Grade of A

Always assume grade A for this card unless it's already selected

Show max EBITDA multiple from range and projected value

Label color should change based on tier (green = A/B, yellow = C, red = D/F)

📊 Visuals
Replace the current numerical score range (30–90) with grade stops on the slider.

Update the heatmap or bar at the bottom to reflect valuation distribution bands by grade.

Example Labels:

Red: F to D

Yellow: C

Green: B to A

🧩 Optional Enhancements
Allow admins to customize multiplier ranges later via dashboard

Consider animations to show value growing as grade improves

Preserve existing styling conventions (Apple Bites font, layout, branding)

✅ Success Criteria
Slider functions using A–F grading scale

Valuation dynamically recalculates and displays based on grade

Page visually and functionally aligns with the Apple Bites valuation report

Text is business-professional and consumer-friendly

I've noticed several issues in the current implementation. Please address the following items precisely:

🧩 GOAL
Fix the Material Dashboard integration so that the free vs paid user logic is handled cleanly, and the layout is consistent. It currently shows a mix of both paid and free views in one screen.

🧭 WHAT I EXPECT
🔹 Sidebar (Left Panel)
A clear tier indicator at the top showing:

Name: Demo User

Email: demo@applebites.ai

Tier: Free (or Growth, Capital, etc.)

Below that: Three buttons:

New Assessment

Upgrade Plan (if Free Tier)

Past Assessments

✅ These must be styled with Material Dashboard components (MDBox, MDBadge, MDBTypography, etc.) and behave based on the user tier.

🔹 Main Panel (Dashboard Content)
Title: “Your Free Assessment Dashboard” (or dynamic tier name)

Status Widget: "Assessment Status" with button to Start Assessment

Quick Actions (New Assessment / Upgrade Plan or View Report)

Past Assessments Box with button and sample text if empty

🧱 COMPONENT INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS
You mentioned the following are available:

MDBox → Replaces Box

MDTypography → Replaces Typography

MDButton → Replaces Button

✅ Please replace all components in this view with their MD* counterparts and maintain current layout & CSS as close as possible.

⚠️ ISSUES I AM SEEING
The current build has mixed layout logic (some components look like the free version, others like paid)

Changes don’t seem to reflect after commits

Sidebar buttons do not behave differently per user tier

Dashboard styling and padding is inconsistent with the rest of the theme

🧪 THINGS TO VERIFY
✅ Conditional rendering: Free tier shows Upgrade button, paid tiers do not.

✅ Styling: All buttons, boxes, and text use Material Dashboard styling.

✅ State: Pull correct tier from current user (e.g. auth.user.tier)

✅ Components render cleanly and fully in /dashboard

🧰 BONUS
If helpful, you may create a new layout file or route that is clean (no legacy code or demo views), as long as:

The layout file clearly replaces the old dashboard view

The sidebar and main content are encapsulated and reusable

You inform me in comments what to update in routing if applicable

Please respond with:

Which components/pages you modified

How the user tier logic is applied

Any temporary files or logic used for testing

Let me know if you want fallback instructions for a simplified version.

DESIGN PROMPT: Argon-Style Redesign of the Business Value Improvement Calculator

🔷 OVERALL STYLING DIRECTION:

Apply Argon’s visual language:

Sleek glassmorphism-inspired containers

Minimalist typography with strong hierarchy

Soft shadows, clean spacing, and subtle hover/scroll animations

Color tones with soft saturation—no overly bright reds/greens

Responsive and mobile-first layout

🧩 SECTION-BY-SECTION STYLING INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Header Section:
Title: Use large, bold text with wide letter spacing.
Font: DM Sans or Inter, weight 600–700

Subtitle: Muted gray (#64748B) with tighter line height

Spacing: Add 32–48px top and bottom margin for clean separation

2. Current vs Potential Value Cards:
Use two responsive, rounded card containers with slight drop shadow and light blur

Font sizes should scale with screen (use clamp() if possible)

Value numbers: bold and dark (#0F172A), use $ formatting with commas

"Move the slider" note → replace with “Adjust the slider below to explore your potential”, styled as muted secondary

3. Adjust Your Operational Grade:
Remove hard border; replace with soft-glow shadow

Highlight “Your Current Grade” using a pill badge (Argon-style chip: rounded, white text, navy background)

Gradient scale bar should use muted Argon-friendly hues:

F: #DC2626

C: #FACC15

A: #22C55E
Add hover tooltips for each grade

Add subtle transition effect when changing grade (opacity fade + number counter)

Replace “Selected Grade” box with a card-style display:

yaml
Copy
Edit
▓ Selected Grade ▓  
Operational Grade: C  
Multiple: 4.2x  
4. How to Improve Your Operational Grade:
Replace current box with a 2-column grid layout with soft card backgrounds

Title: use H3 styling, semibold

Each category (Financial Performance, Market Position, etc.):

Use Argon icon bullets (or emojis) to draw the eye

Highlight the grade + multiple in a badge-style callout (e.g., “Grade A: 7.5x” as a colored pill or label)

Use tighter spacing and slightly larger font for category descriptions

🎯 FUNCTIONAL UPGRADES (Optional but Recommended):

Add a “Next Step” CTA under the chart:

“Get Your Customized Value Roadmap →” (button styled in Argon blue #3B82F6, rounded full, shadow on hover)

Enable sharing or download of results as PDF snapshot (Argon style export modal)

Make slider or grade bar touch-responsive for mobile UX

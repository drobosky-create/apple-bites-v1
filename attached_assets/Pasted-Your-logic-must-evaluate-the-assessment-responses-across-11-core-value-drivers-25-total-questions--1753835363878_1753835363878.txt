Your logic must evaluate the assessment responses across 11 core value drivers (25 total questions) and apply the following rules:

1. Use these scoring indicators from the assessment:
   - Each question is scored from 0 to 5
   - Core dimensions to evaluate include:
     - Adjusted EBITDA estimate (inferred from margin + industry question)
     - Financial performance (Q1â€“Q3)
     - Recurring revenue strength (Q4â€“Q6)
     - Growth potential (Q7â€“Q8)
     - Owner dependency (Q9â€“Q10)
     - Customer concentration (Q11)
     - Customer segment and satisfaction (Q12â€“Q14)
     - Operational maturity (Q17â€“Q18)
     - Scalability (Q19â€“Q21)
     - Management team strength (Q21â€“Q22)
     - Differentiation and brand (Q23â€“Q25)

2. Based on the above inputs, return a JSON array of **3â€“4 top-fit deal structures**, each with:
   - `dealType`: short name (e.g., "Private Equity Platform")
   - `rationale`: 1â€“2 sentence reason for inclusion (include key trigger points)
   - `relevanceScore`: a float from 0â€“1 indicating how well it fits the business profile
   - `tags`: optional list of traits that triggered this match (e.g., ["High Recurring Revenue", "Delegated Ops"])

3. Match deals using this structured list (abbreviated view):
   - `Strategic Acquisition`
   - `Private Equity Platform`
   - `Add-On Acquisition`
   - `Roll-Up`
   - `Growth Equity`
   - `Management Buyout (MBO)`
   - `Leveraged Buyout (LBO)`
   - `Minority Recapitalization`
   - `Owner-Operator Acquisition`
   - `SBA-Backed Deal`
   - `Seller-Financed Exit`
   - `Search Fund Acquisition`
   - `Turnaround Investment`
   - `SaaS Roll-Up`
   - `ESOP`
   - `Asset Sale`
   - `Joint Venture`
   - `Merger of Equals` (rare)

4. Mapping logic rules (examples):
   - Businesses with EBITDA > $10M and avg Financial + Mgmt scores â‰¥ 4.0 â†’ Recommend "Private Equity Platform"
   - High Recurring Revenue (Q4â€“Q6 avg â‰¥ 4) â†’ Add "SaaS Roll-Up" to the mix
   - Owner Dependency avg < 3.0 â†’ Exclude MBO, flag "Owner-Op" or "Search Fund"
   - Customer Concentration > 50% and Financial Score < 9 â†’ Add "Turnaround" or "Seller Financing"
   - Differentiation + Delegated Ops + Growth â‰¥ 4 â†’ Favor "Strategic Acquisition" or "Growth Equity"
   - If no criteria match well, return "Asset Sale" with rationale

5. Output format:
```json
[
  {
    "dealType": "Add-On Acquisition",
    "rationale": "Your business shows strong recurring revenue and scalable operations, making it attractive as a bolt-on for a larger platform.",
    "relevanceScore": 0.92,
    "tags": ["Recurring Revenue", "Delegated Ops", "Moderate Valuation"]
  },
  {
    "dealType": "Growth Equity",
    "rationale": "With above-average projected growth and a partially developed management team, you are a candidate for minority investment.",
    "relevanceScore": 0.88,
    "tags": ["Growth Potential", "Emerging Team"]
  },
  ...
]
Do not list more than 4 deals. Prioritize precision over breadth.

If asked to explain your logic, cite the question categories and scores you used in your match.

### ðŸ”§ Optional Agent Configuration Notes

If you're building this into the backend:
- Use the question data stored in `full_apple_bites_questions_1751898553174.json`
- Normalize question scores to 0â€“5 scale
- Use `businessProfile` object passed from the frontend assessment results
- Implement a `generateDealStructureFit(businessProfile)` function that outputs the JSON array

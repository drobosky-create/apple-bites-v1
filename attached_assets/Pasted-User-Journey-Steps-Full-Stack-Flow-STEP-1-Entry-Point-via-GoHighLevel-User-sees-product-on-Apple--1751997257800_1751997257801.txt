User Journey Steps (Full Stack Flow)
STEP 1: Entry Point via GoHighLevel
User sees product on Apple Bites landing page (hosted in GoHighLevel or embedded)

Clicks on tier-based offer (Free, $795, or $3,495)

Checkout happens inside GHL using Stripe

‚¨áÔ∏è Post-purchase tag applied (e.g., AppleBites_Tier1, AppleBites_Tier2)

‚¨áÔ∏è GHL webhook fires to Replit to start user tracking

STEP 2: Replit Assessment Initialization
Replit receives webhook with:

Name

Email

Tier ID

GHL Contact ID (optional)

Replit app creates user session and redirects them to the correct assessment:

Tier 1: Founder's Snapshot (basic, slider-based)

Tier 2: Growth & Exit (10-core driver deep dive)

Tier 3: Full Capital Market Plan

One-question-per-screen format

User data is stored in PostgreSQL (linked to email + GHL ID)

STEP 3: Scoring + Report Generation
On form submission:

Replit calculates value estimate using internal multiplier logic

A PDF report is generated (via GPT, HTML2PDF or similar)

Summary includes:

Valuation range

Grade heatmap (A‚ÄìF)

Commentary on top drivers and detractors

Report stored + email triggered

STEP 4: Send Data Back to GHL (via Webhook)
Replit fires a webhook back to GHL including:

Score + valuation range

Tier tag (if not already applied)

Completion timestamp

Optional: dynamic fields (e.g., top 3 pain points, NAICS code)

GHL receives webhook and updates contact record

STEP 5: Trigger Next Workflow in GHL
Based on webhook receipt + tag, GHL:

Sends thank-you email

Adds user to follow-up sequence

e.g., pitch Tier 2 after Free

Book consultation if Tier 2

VIP invite if Tier 3

Creates task for internal team to review result or follow up

‚öôÔ∏è Technical Notes
All contact tracking must persist across tiers using the same email

Webhooks should be asynchronous but fire in under 2 seconds

Replit must store record of:

Contact ID (GHL)

Tier

Score + breakdown

Report URL

Submission timestamp

üß™ Optional Enhancements (Phase 2)
Build dashboard view for internal team to search/export assessments

Add visual chart in Replit (heatmap or radar)

Add ‚ÄúSchedule Call‚Äù CTA on results screen that pushes user to GHL calendar

Sync Stripe purchase IDs for auditing and product access gating

2. Legacy Argon component files (.js extensions)
3. Old development screenshots (pre-July 2025)
4. Duplicate text instruction files

### Archive (Move to organized folders)
1. Recent screenshots → `/docs/screenshots/`
2. Brand assets → `/docs/brand/`
3. Video files → `/docs/videos/`
4. User requirements → `/docs/requirements/`

### Keep Active
1. Current project logos
2. Recent user feedback files

## Storage Impact
- Current directory size is bloated with development artifacts
- Estimated 70% of files can be archived or removed
- Will improve project navigation and performance

## Next Steps
1. Create organized folder structure
2. Move essential files to appropriate locations
3. Archive historical development files
4. Remove deprecated code components
5. Update project documentation references

What’s Working Now
✅ Clear contrast in numbers (C → B jump is obvious).

✅ Highlighted gain box is effective and emotionally satisfying (+35.7% increase is money language).

✅ Interactive section feels purposeful now.

🔧 Fine-Tuning Suggestions
1. Badge Label: "Current Value" / "Potential Value"
These are good — but maybe add a “You are here” badge on the current grade (C) or next to "Current Value" for clarity.

Example:
Current Value → Current Value (You are here)

2. Grade Box Highlighting
Right now, C is active with a red “Current” label.
But consider also subtly highlighting the selected grade (e.g., B) in a way that doesn't compete with the orange.

✅ Solution: Add a border or glow to the selected target grade (e.g., B)
🛑 Avoid strong dual highlights; instead differentiate “Current” vs. “Selected”

3. Slider Wording (Potential Box)
“Adjust the slider below to explore your potential”
This line may be outdated or unnecessary if there’s no slider anymore — you now have a clickable grade bar.

✅ Suggestion:
Change to something like:

“Based on selected grade”
or
“Estimated increase if operational grade improves to B”

4. Visual Anchor Hierarchy
Currently, the “$ Gain” box (under Potential Value) is very wide, but it’s not a CTA. Consider:

Making it smaller / pill-shaped

Making it a popup or tooltip after a grade is clicked

Or removing the border and using green highlighted text below the main value

📐 Optional Layout Shuffle
If you want to really simplify:

I was thinking about a chart or graph like this where its a stack of coins or similar

ChatGPT said:
That stacked coin-style chart you just posted is 🔥 — it blends data + metaphor in a way that’s visually appealing and immediately intuitive. It would be a perfect fit for showing valuation gains across grades (F → A) instead of just flat sliders or boxes.

Here’s how we could adapt it to the Apple Bites valuation app:

🍏 Concept: Valuation Growth Stack
Grade	Bar Style	Color	Label	Metaphor
F	2 short coins	Light Gray	$X / 2.0x EBITDA	"Poor"
D	3 short coins	Gray	$X / 3.0x EBITDA	"Below Avg"
C	4.2 coins (highlighted)	Orange	$25M / 4.2x EBITDA	"Current"
B	5.7 coins	Blue	$34M / 5.7x EBITDA	"Target"
A	7.5 coins	Green	$X / 7.5x EBITDA	"Excellent"

✅ Why this works:
Stacked coins = valuation building up, a metaphor buyers and sellers get instinctively.

You can visually show the “leap” from C → B in height and color.

Color-coding (gray → orange → green) clearly implies improvement.

It blends score + dollars in one view.

🔧 Design Enhancements:
The “Current Grade” coin stack could have a glowing border or bounce-in animation on page load.

Hover or tap could show:

“Your value at this grade: $25,108,687.8 (4.2x Multiple)”
“Potential value at next grade: $34,076,076.3 (5.7x Multiple)”

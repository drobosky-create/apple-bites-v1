Do you feel like this is in line with the Argon styling we have been changing everything to?


ChatGPT said:
No—what you have now is functionally clean, but it under-delivers on visual impact when compared to the rest of the ArgonBox-based UI styling you’ve adopted across the Apple Bites platform. Here's why:

⚖️ Comparison to Argon Design Standards
Element	Current UI	Argon Design System	Verdict
Step Circles	Small, flat, minimal shadow	Bold, elevated, gradient-based with prominent depth	Too understated
Icons	Compact, generic sizing (h-4 w-4)	Larger icons (h-5+) with color contrast for hierarchy	Under-scaled
"Current" Pills	Small, pale label (text-xs)	Argon emphasizes bold indicators (text-sm+, often outlined or layered)	Visually weak
Overall Flow UI	Functional, low interaction feedback	Argon favors feedback-rich, hover-responsive, animated components	Lacks engagement

📌 Argon-Specific Adjustments (Recommended)
These will bring it visually and behaviorally in line with other ArgonBox elements you've implemented:

✋ Reframing Assumptions
What you might be taking for granted:

That users intuitively grasp "Current" from a small badge.

That minimal styling equals clarity.

That resizing is cosmetic. It’s not—hierarchy equals cognition.

🧭 Final Thought
If the goal is to establish Apple Bites as a premium diagnostic platform, this UI element needs to align with your Argon-based design system—and it’s currently 20–30% off the mark in visual weight and polish.

Why the TeamTrack dashboard never shows

Routing split by flag

When IS_UNIFIED_SHELL is true, /workspace and /workspace/:rest* both go to WorkspaceLayout.

That means the TeamTrack layout can only appear if WorkspaceLayout wraps it.

In TeamTrack, the MaterialDashboardLayout is the top-level wrapper. In AppleBites, it‚Äôs one level down inside WorkspaceLayout.

Fallback is swallowing /workspace

In your WorkspaceLayout.tsx, the last route is <CRMModule /> (or role-aware fallback if you patched it).

With Wouter, if no other route matches, that fallback route always wins, so you never actually see a blank MaterialDashboardLayout shell.

Export mismatch risk

In your edits, you flipped between:

import MaterialDashboardLayout from "@/layouts/TeamTrack/MaterialDashboardLayout";
// vs
import { MaterialDashboardLayout } from "@/layouts/TeamTrack/MaterialDashboardLayout";


If the export doesn‚Äôt match the import, React silently renders nothing for the shell. That would make it look like ‚Äúthe dashboard doesn‚Äôt work.‚Äù

‚úÖ How to prove the shell is working

Temporarily strip WorkspaceLayout down to just the layout:

// client/src/pages/workspace/WorkspaceLayout.tsx
import React from "react";
import MaterialDashboardLayout from "@/layouts/TeamTrack/MaterialDashboardLayout";

export default function WorkspaceLayout() {
  return (
    <MaterialDashboardLayout>
      <div style={{ padding: 20 }}>
        <h1>Inside TeamTrack Shell ‚úÖ</h1>
      </div>
    </MaterialDashboardLayout>
  );
}


Then go to /workspace.

If you see the sidebar + header (TeamTrack look), the shell is working.

If you only see ‚ÄúInside TeamTrack Shell‚Äù with no sidebar, then your import/export is broken.

üîß Next Steps

Fix the import/export mismatch

Open MaterialDashboardLayout.tsx.

If it ends with export default MaterialDashboardLayout;, use:

import MaterialDashboardLayout from "@/layouts/TeamTrack/MaterialDashboardLayout";


If it ends with export const MaterialDashboardLayout = ..., then use:

import { MaterialDashboardLayout } from "@/layouts/TeamTrack/MaterialDashboardLayout";


Add back your routes after confirming shell

Once the shell renders, put the Switch with CRM/VDR/Admin back inside.

Keep the role-aware fallback at the bottom:

<Route>{isAdmin ? <AssessmentAdminModule /> : <CRMModule />}</Route>


Sidebar config comes next

After the shell is confirmed, adjust TeamTrackSidebar.tsx (or sidebar.tsx you copied from TeamTrack) to only show the AppleBites pages.

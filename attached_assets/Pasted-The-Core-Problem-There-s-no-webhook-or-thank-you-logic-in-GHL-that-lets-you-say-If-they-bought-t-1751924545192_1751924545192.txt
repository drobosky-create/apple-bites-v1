The Core Problem:
There’s no webhook or thank-you logic in GHL that lets you say:

"If they bought this specific $795 Growth & Exit Assessment, send them to this URL."

You only get a generic thank-you, regardless of the product purchased. So we need a workaround that ties payment to identity, and lets your app unlock the right content.

✅ Best Workaround: Email Gated Access + LocalStorage Bridge
Here's how you can make it work securely and reliably:

Step 1: Capture Email Before Redirecting to GHL
Before the user clicks “Buy Now” from your app, save their email and assessment data to localStorage and your backend.

They click:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
[ Get Growth & Exit Assessment - $795 ]
→ Save: email + answers to localStorage or DB
→ Redirect to GHL checkout
Step 2: After Payment, GHL Thank-You Page Says:
✅ Thanks for your purchase!
To access your full assessment results, enter the email you used at checkout below:

html
Copy
Edit
<form action="https://your-app.com/strategic-assessment-access">
  <input type="email" name="email" placeholder="Enter your email" required />
  <button type="submit">Continue</button>
</form>
You can post this form to your frontend, which can check for:

Existing localStorage data by email

Or call your backend to fetch assessment results by email

Step 3: Load Data in Your App Based on Email
In strategic-assessment-access, you:

Check localStorage (or backend) for matching email

Show a success message

Rehydrate their results, unlock results, etc.

tsx
Copy
Edit
if (storedEmail === emailEntered && localStorage.hasData()) {
  showResults();
} else {
  showError("We couldn't find your assessment. Please retake or contact support.");
}
🔁 Optional: Use GoHighLevel Webhook + Tag
If you want to go deeper and segment purchases:

Set up a GHL workflow that adds a specific tag when someone buys the Growth & Exit Assessment.

Use Zapier or a custom webhook to ping your app with email + tag.

That way, your app knows this person bought the assessment.

🧠 TL;DR — Here's What You Can Do Now:
✅ Update the GHL Thank You Page to include:

“To continue your assessment, enter your email to verify purchase”

✅ Save user email and local data in localStorage or your backend before redirect

✅ On return, allow users to type in their email → match it → unlock content

Based on what I’m seeing in your current clean dashboard, you’re 95% there. Here’s a focused action plan to get you the rest of the way, followed by a Replit prompt tailored specifically for your current layout and progress:

🔧 Issues to Fix (From Screenshot)
Tier Badge (FREE)

✅ Present and styled correctly.

🔍 Improvement: Add color logic (e.g., gray for Free, blue for Growth, gold for Capital).

Duplicate CTA: “Start Assessment” vs. “Get Started”

🎯 Solution: Only show one primary action button for new assessments.

“Start Assessment” and “Get Started” are redundant.

Empty State for Past Assessments

✅ Message is fine.

🔍 Improvement: Add subtle animation or hover effect to encourage interaction.

Upgrade Plan Logic

✅ Shows for Free users.

🔍 Confirm that this section disappears entirely for paid users.

Sidebar Layout

✅ Solid. Ensure spacing and button stacking hold up responsively.

✅ Copy-and-Paste Prompt for Replit AI Agent
🎯 Goal: Finalize and polish the clean dashboard layout to eliminate redundancy and apply tier-specific UI logic. The current layout is very close — just needs final refinements.

✅ Objective: Finalize the clean dashboard UI at `dashboard-clean.tsx` by fixing these remaining items:

1. 🛑 Remove redundancy between the "Start Assessment" button at the top and the "Get Started" button in the "New Assessment" card. Only one should remain.
   - Keep just the "Get Started" button inside the card for consistency.

2. 🎨 Ensure the `MDBadge` for user tier has the following color mapping:
   - FREE: gray (`gradient="secondary"`)
   - GROWTH: blue (`gradient="info"`)
   - CAPITAL: gold (`gradient="warning"` or custom gradient if needed)

3. 🧠 Tier Logic (based on user.tier):
```ts
if (tier === 'free') {
  showUpgrade = true;
  dashboardTitle = 'Your Free Assessment Dashboard';
} else if (tier === 'growth') {
  showUpgrade = false;
  dashboardTitle = 'Your Growth Plan Dashboard';
} else if (tier === 'capital') {
  showUpgrade = false;
  dashboardTitle = 'Your Capital Readiness Dashboard';
}
🚫 The "Upgrade Plan" card and sidebar button should only appear if tier === 'free'. Hide them for paid users.

✅ Sidebar button spacing and vertical alignment should use MDBox and gap props for consistent layout.

⏳ The "Past Assessments" empty state is fine. Optionally:

Add light animation or a dimmed hover effect on the clock icon.

Add a reminder tooltip like “Your first assessment will appear here.”

📐 Overall layout should remain responsive and use MDBox, MDTypography, MDButton, MDCard, and MDBadge only (no raw HTML or non-styled components).

🌐 Route already live and tested. Just polish and finalize!

Once this final polish is implemented, your Free-tier dashboard will be clean, conversion-optimized, and fully tier-driven. Let me know when you’re ready to check the Growth and Capital tier versions next!
